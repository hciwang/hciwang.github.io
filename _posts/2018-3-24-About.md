## What Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is about?

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as a field of computing concerns with principles, concepts, methods and approaches for designing, prototyping and evaluating user interfaces and computer systems, so that they are usable, useful and enjoyable for the users to use. The focus of modern HCI is on how to introduce quality experiences of use through design to users (also commonly referred as "user experience"). As the span of technologies that ultimately reach or involve users is broad nowadays, HCI is not only a vibrant topic of academic interest, but also a topic crucial to the development of systems and products.

## What this course is aboout?

This course is an introductory HCI course for undergraduate students. Throughout this course, students will actively engage in course activities designed to familiarize students with the fundamental principles, concepts and methods for designing, prototyping and evaluating user interface and user-oriented computing applications. 

Students will learn how to differentiate good versus bad designs systematically with the design principles in HCI. Students will then engage in learning how to come up with "good designs" rather than bad ones, generating and identifying good design ideas from a systematic process. Students will learn about the notion and sample techniques for fast-prototyping and using low-fidelity prototypes to support communication in and out of a design team. Students will learn how to evaluate their designs, tightly connecting to the initial questions on the identification of good designs. Going through the design cycle will help students to see the sophistication and complexity underlying the design activities, which further motivate advanced HCI research topics, such as refined design processes, concepts and methods for understanding users, novel interaction techniques, and designs to support multi-person collaboration.

Specific learning goals of this course include: (1) being able to use and discuss the key concepts of HCI, (2) being able to engage in the process of user-centered design activities for system design and prototyping, (3) being able to critically discuss and evaluate the usability of existing products, (4) knowing the range of tools and methods for understanding users and identifying user needs, (5) having the awareness of advanced HCI topics and the current state of art.

## Course strucrture

* Lecture: 1.5 hour per week, given by the instructor.
* Studio: 0.5 hour explanation, and 1 hour for student practices, led by the instructor and the TAs.
* Discussion: 1 hour per week, led by TAs for discussions of assignments and the course project.
* Other course activities include one course project (divided into proposal, progress report and final presentation/report), three assignments, and three sets of paper readings. 
** For paper readings, students can obtain credit points by posting and sharing comments with the class.
