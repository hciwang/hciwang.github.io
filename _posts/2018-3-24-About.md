In Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), we focus on principles, concepts, and methods for designing, prototyping and evaluating user interfaces and computer systems, so that they are usable, useful and enjoyable for the users to use. The focus of modern HCI is on how to introduce quality experiences of use through design to users (also commonly referred as "user experience").

This course is an introductory HCI course for undergraduate students. Throughout this course, students will actively engage in course activities designed to familiarize students with the fundamental principles, concepts and methods for designing, prototyping and evaluating user interface and user-oriented computing applications.
